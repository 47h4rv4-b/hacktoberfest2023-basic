# Given an array with both positive and negative integers, find the subarray which gives maximum sum and return the starting and ending indices.

## A brief overview

You are given an integer array, containing both positive and negative numbers. Find the subarray whose elements when added given the maximum possible sum in the array, and return the starting and ending indices of the subarray (Assume array indices are as usual and start from 0 to array.size-1)

## Sample test cases

```
input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
output: 0 4
```

```
input: [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
output: 2 6
```

```
input: [-2, -1, -9, 0, -4, 5, 1, -10]
output: 5 6
```

```
input: [0, -8, -2, -1, -5, -6]
output: 0 0
```

## Edge cases
```
input: [1, 3, 2, 4, -21, 6, 4]
```

```
input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
