# Smallest Positive Integer that cannot be represented as Sum of Elements of the given array
## A brief overview

Given an array of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that 
cannot be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of a given set. 

## Sample Test Case

```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15};
Output: 2
```
```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
Output: 5
```
```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 4};
Output: 10
```
```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40};
Output: 4
```
```
Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
Output: 22
```
