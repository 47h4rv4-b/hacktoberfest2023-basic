#  Find all possible subsets of a given set.
## A brief overview
Given an array Arr[] of size N, print all the subsets of the array.

Subset: A subset of an array is a tuple that can be obtained from the 
array by removing some (possibly all) elements of it

## Sample test cases

```
Input: N = 3, Arr = [1, 2, 3]
Output: {}
{1}
{1, 2}
{1, 2, 3}
{1, 3}
{2}
{2, 3}
{3}
```
