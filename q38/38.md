# Given a positive integer n, you can apply one of the following operations:
#If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
#If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
#Return the minimum number of operations needed for n to become 1.

## A brief overview

Given a number N. The task is to reduce the given number N to 1 in the minimum number of steps. You can perform any one of the below operations in each step.

- Operation 1: If the number is even then you can divide the number by 2.
- Operation 2: If the number is odd then you are allowed to perform either (n+1) or (n-1).

You need to print the minimum number of steps required to reduce the number N to 1 by performing the above operations.
