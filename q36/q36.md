# Determine if Linked List Has a Cycle

## Brief overview
The question is to determine whether a given linked list has a cycle or not. You are given the head of a linked list as input, and your task is to check if there is any cycle (loop) in the linked list. A cycle in a linked list occurs when a node points back to a previous node in the list, forming a loop.

## Test cases
Test Case 1:
Input:
- Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 (The last node points back to node 2)
Expected Output: True

Test Case 2:
Input:
- Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (No cycle)
Expected Output: False

Test Case 3:
Input:
- Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 3 (The last node points back to node 3)
Expected Output: True

Test Case 4:
Input:
- Linked List: 1 -> 1 (A single-node list where it points back to itself)
Expected Output: True

Test Case 5:
Input:
- Linked List: (Empty list)
Expected Output: False
