# Given two strings, write a program that efficiently finds the longest common subsequence.

## A brief overview

If S1 and S2 are the two given sequences then, Z is the common subsequence of S1 and S2 if Z is a subsequence of both S1 and S2. Furthermore, Z must be a strictly increasing sequence of the indices of both S1 and S2.Return length of Z
