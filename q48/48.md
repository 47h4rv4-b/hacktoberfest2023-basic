# Count Ways to Express a Number as the Sum of Consecutive Natural Numbers.

## A brief overview

We are given a number N, and we want the count of ways we can represent N as a sum of consecutive natural numbers.
Example: There are 3 ways to represent 15 as sum of consecutive natural numbers as follows:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
7 + 8 = 15

## Sample test cases

```
input:3
output:1
```

```
input:15
output:3
```

```
input:10
output:1
```
