# Find the Number of Combinations, Given N and R

## A brief overview

Given integers 'n' and 'r' (n >= r & n > 0, r >= 0) as inputs from the user, find the number of combinations (nCr), i.e., the number of ways of picking 'r' objects from the given 'n' objects at a time.

## Sample test cases

```
