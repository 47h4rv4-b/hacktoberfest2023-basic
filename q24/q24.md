# Given two sorted arrays, write a function to merge them into a single sorted array without duplicates.

## A brief overview

You are given two sorted (non-decreasing) integer arrays as input. Write a function which will merge the two arrays into a single sorted array without duplicates and return this array. Suppose the sizes of the arrays are m, n respectively, then the size of the final merged array should be less than or equal to (m + n).

## Sample test cases

```
input: [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8], [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7]
output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]
```

```
input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

```
input: [4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 10], [7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10]
output: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

```
input: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
```
