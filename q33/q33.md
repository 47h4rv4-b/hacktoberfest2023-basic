# Equivalent Binary Search Trees.

## Brief overview
The question is to determine if two binary search trees (BSTs) are the same. You are given the roots of two BSTs as arguments, and your task is to compare the structures and values of these trees to determine if they are identical. In a valid solution, both the structure and values of the BSTs must match for them to be considered the same.

## Test cases
Test Case 1:
BST1:
      2
     / \
    1   3

BST2:
      2
     / \
    1   3

Test Case 2:
BST1:
      2
     / \
    1   3

BST2:
      2
       \
        3

Test Case 3:
BST1: (Empty)

BST2: (Empty)

Test Case 4:
BST1:
      2
     / \
    1   3

BST2:
      2
     / \
    1   4

Test Case 5:
BST1: (A large BST with a complex structure)
                 5
               /   \
              3     8
             / \   / \
            2   4 6   9
           /       \
          1         7

BST2: (A copy of BST1 with the same structure)
                 5
               /   \
              3     8
             / \   / \
            2   4 6   9
           /       \
          1         7
