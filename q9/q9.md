# Consider a ternary tree (each node has a maximum of 3 children). Perform inorder traversal in such a way that if a node has a prime value, it's subtrees are pruned.
## A brief overview
Perform an inorder traversal on a ternary tree, removing subtrees of nodes with prime values during traversal.
## Smaple test cases
```
Input: Tree with nodes [5, 3, 9, 2, 7]
Output: [2, 5, 7, 9]
Explanation: Prune nodes 3 (prime) and its subtrees.
```
```
Input: Tree with nodes [8, 2, 15, 4, 10, 17]
Output: [2, 4, 8, 10, 15, 17]
Explanation: No prime nodes, so no pruning.
```
```
Input: Tree with nodes [3, 2, 7, 5, 11]
Output: []
Explanation: All nodes are prime, so the tree is pruned entirely.
```
```
Input: Tree with nodes [6, 2, 4, 3, 9]
Output: [2, 3, 4, 6, 9]
Explanation: Prune node 6 (prime) and its subtrees.
```
```
Input: Tree with nodes [12, 13, 15, 17, 19]
Output: [12, 13, 15, 17, 19]
Explanation: No prime nodes, so no pruning occurs.
