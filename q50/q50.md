# Count Trailing Zeros in Factorial

## A brief overview

Given an integer 'n' as input from the user. Write a function that will count the number of trailing zeroes (at the end of the number, not sandwiched between two non-zero numbers) in the factorial of the given number, n!, and output it to the user.

## Sample test cases

```
input: 5!
output: 1
```

```
input: 20!
output: 4
```

```
input: 100!
