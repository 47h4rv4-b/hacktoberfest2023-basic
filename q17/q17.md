# Given an array and integer k, find the closest pair of elements which add up to k.

## A brief overview

You are given an array of integers and a target integer k. Find the closest pair of elements that add up to the target. Return -1 if there doesn't exist a pair. 

## Sample test cases

```
input: [1, 2, 13, 41, 9, 7]  target = 14
output: 1 13
```

```
input: [1, 2, 10, 41, 9, 7]  target = 11
output: 1 10
```

```
input: [3, 7, 10, 2, 5, 8, 21, 12, 6]  target = 22
output: -1
```

```
input: [4, 2, 3, 7, 9, 8]  target = 11
