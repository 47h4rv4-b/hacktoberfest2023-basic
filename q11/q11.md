# Consider a ladder of n steps. A monkey can climb the ladder either 1 step or 2 steps at a time. Find the number of ways in which the monkey climbs the ladder exactly.
## A brief overview
Determine the number of ways a monkey can climb an n-step ladder, taking either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

## Sample test cases
```
Case:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: With only one step, the monkey can climb the ladder in one way (1 step).
```
```
Case:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: With two steps, the monkey can climb the ladder in two ways (1+1 step or 2 steps).
```
```
Case:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: With three steps, the monkey can climb the ladder in three ways (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1 steps).
```
```
Case:
Input: n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: With four steps, the monkey can climb the ladder in five ways (1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2+2 steps).
```
```
Case:
Input: n = 5
Output: 8
Explanation: With five steps, the monkey can climb the ladder in eight ways (1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+2+2, 2+1+2, 2+2+1 steps).
```
