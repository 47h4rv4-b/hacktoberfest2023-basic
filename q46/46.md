# Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] â†’ [a,1,b,2,c,3].

## A brief overview

Take two input arrays and combine them by taking elements from each array alternatively.

## Sample test cases

```
input:[1,2,3],[4,5,6]
output:[1,4,2,5,3,6]
```

```
input:[1,4,2],[5,3,6]
output:[1,5,4,3,2,6]
```

```
input:[1,3,5][2,4,6]
output:[1,2,3,4,5,6]
```
