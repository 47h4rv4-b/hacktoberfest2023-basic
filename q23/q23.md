# Write a Program to Concatenate Two Strings

## A brief overview

You are given two strings(without spaces) as an input from the user. Create a function which will take these two strings and 'concatenate' them, i.e., join the end of the first string to the beginning of the other.

## Sample test cases

```
input: "CSClub", "IIITDM"
output: "CSClubIIITDM"
```

```
input: "OMGSuch", "NicePeople"
output: "OMGSuchNicePeople"
```

```
input: "Manchester", "United"
output: "ManchesterUnited"
```

```
input: "Asdfg", "gfdsA"
output: "AsdfggfdsA"
```
