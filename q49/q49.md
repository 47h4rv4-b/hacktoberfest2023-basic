# Minimum Steps Required to Make Product Equal to One

## A brief overview

Given an array of size 'n' filled with positive and negative integers. Find the minimum number of steps required to make the product of all elements in the array equal to one in minimum number of steps possible. (NOTE:- a 'step' here refers to incrementing or decrementing an element of the array by 1, for example, 4 to 1 is 3 'steps', 4->3, 3->2, 2->1)

## Sample test cases

```
input: [2, 4, 0]
output: 5
```

```
input: [1, -1, 2, -2, 3]
output: 4
```

```
input: [1, -1, -1]
output: 0
```

```
input: [1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1]
output: 2
```
