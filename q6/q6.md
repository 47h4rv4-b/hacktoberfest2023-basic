# Given two sorted arrays of sizes m, n respectively. Merge the two arrays into a third sorted array of size m + n.(same question can be done with two linked lists)
## A brief overview
Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.

## Sample test cases
```
Input: arr1[] = { 1, 3, 4, 5}, arr2[] = {2, 4, 6, 8} 
Output: arr3[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8}
```
```
Input: arr1[] = { 5, 8, 9}, arr2[] = {4, 7, 8} 
Output: arr3[] = {4, 5, 7, 8, 8, 9}
```
