# Write an efficient algorithm to calculate the Sum-Product of digits of input float number.

## A brief overview

The following is the definition of Sum-Product of digits of a float : the numbers at 'i'th place after the decimal point should be multiplied with number at the 'i'th place before decimal point. i.e. 1/10th place should be multiplied with 10s place and 1/100th place should be multiplied with 100s place... .

## Sample test cases

```
input:123.123
output:10
```

```
input:400.000
output:0
```

```
input:1.23
output:2
```
