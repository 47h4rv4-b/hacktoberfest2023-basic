# Write a program to emulate a 4 bit adder, input given in binary as strings.

## A brief overview

You are given two 4 bit binary numbers (in string format) as inputs. Write a program to perform binary addition of the two numbers, which works similar to a 4-bit adder

## Sample test cases

```
input: 0001 0010
output: 0011
```

```
input: 1000 0000
output: 1000
```

```
input: 1011 0011
output: 1110
```

```
input: 1100 0110
output: 1 0010
```
