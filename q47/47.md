# Write a program to check if the given strings are anagram or not.

## A brief overview

An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

## Sample test cases

```
input:listen,silent
output:True
```

```
input:gram,arm
output:False
```

```
input:heart,earth
output:True
```
