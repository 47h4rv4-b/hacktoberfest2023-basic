# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

## Brief overview
The question is to convert a sorted array into a binary search tree (BST). You are given a sorted array as input, and your task is to construct a balanced BST from the given array. A balanced BST is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Test cases
Test Case 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Expected Output:
BST:
    2
   / \
  1   3

Test Case 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Expected Output:
BST:
      3
     / \
    2   4
   /     \
  1       5

Test Case 3:
Input: [1]
Expected Output:
BST:
  1

Test Case 4:
Input: [1, 2]
Expected Output:
BST:
  2
 /
1

Test Case 5:
Input: []
Expected Output: (Empty BST)
